# Basic-Scraper
A basic and maybe not so efficient HTTP client.

Just a small side project to exercise Python and learn web development.

It's main purpose is to log in to Moodle and to check if any new homework was uploaded since the last run.

The script can also be used as a very basic scraper, but requires http and html knowledge to be used, as it doesn't know how to handle the data sent by the server - only log it.
