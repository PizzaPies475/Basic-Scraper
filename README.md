# Basic-Scraper
A basic and maybe not so efficient HTTP client.

Just a small side project to exercise Python and learn about networks.

It's main purpose is to log in to Moodle and to check if any new homework was uploaded since the last run.

It can also be used to map a site with all of the links found in it (scraper basically).
